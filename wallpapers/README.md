# Wallpapers Folder

This folder contains my favorite wallpapers and scripts to help me personalize my desktop environment.

## How I Use This Folder

- I keep wallpapers I like here for quick access and easy setup.
- I add scripts to automate downloading and setting wallpapers on my system.
- I update or replace wallpapers as my preferences change.

## Example Scripts

### install-wallpapers.sh (macOS/Linux)
- Downloads a wallpaper from Wallhaven and sets it as the desktop background on all displays (macOS only).
- You can modify this script or add new ones for different wallpapers or platforms.

### install-wallpapers.ps1 (Windows)
- Downloads a wallpaper from Wallhaven and optionally sets it as the desktop background.
- Uses Windows API to set the wallpaper with proper scaling options.

## Usage

### macOS/Linux
```bash
chmod +x install-wallpapers.sh
./install-wallpapers.sh
```

### Windows
```powershell
.\install-wallpapers.ps1
```

The Windows script will ask if you want to set the wallpaper as your desktop background after downloading it.

I update this folder as my collection grows or my tastes change. Add, remove, or replace wallpapers and scripts as needed!

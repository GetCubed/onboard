# Themes Folder

This folder contains themes I use to customize my development environment.

## Available Themes

### Catppuccin Macchiato for Terminal.app
- A soothing pastel theme for macOS Terminal.app, part of the Catppuccin theme family.
- Source: https://github.com/catppuccin/Terminal.app
- I recommend checking out more Catppuccin themes at: https://catppuccin.com

## Installation Instructions

To install all available themes:

```sh
chmod +x install-themes.sh
./install-themes.sh
```

This will download and import the Catppuccin Macchiato theme into Terminal.app. I can then select it in Terminal Preferences > Profiles.

When I add more themes, I place their files and installation scripts here, and update this README with details.

# onboard

Welcome to my personal onboarding repository! This repo is my toolkit for setting up a new development environment on any PC. Whenever I get a new machine, I just clone this repo to bring in all the things that make my workflow comfortable and productive.

## What I keep here

- Wallpapers I like
- Scripts to automate setup and configuration
- Bookmarks for browsers
- Handy code snippets
- Any other files or resources I want quick access to

## Why I made this

Setting up a new computer can be tedious. With this repo, I can skip the repetitive steps and get straight to work. Everything I need is in one place, ready to go.

## How I use it

1. Open a terminal running zsh.
2. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/getcubed/onboard.git
3. Run or review the setup scripts (zsh) and follow any instructions.
4. Add new files or update existing ones as my preferences change.

## Folder structure

- `scripts/` – My setup and automation scripts
- `wallpapers/` – My favorite backgrounds
- `bookmarks/` – Browser bookmarks
- `snippets/` – Code snippets and utilities
- `README.md` – This file

I update and reorganize these folders as needed.
